# Status-meanings

Online - Ontab and likely engaging with my friends/someone - feel free to int unless said otherwise!
Looking for chat - Rare, probably want to interact with someone (bored or other reasons)
Looking for roleplay - I never ever use this unless I'm extremely bored and seeking out a roleplay at docks.
Away - not focused on tab, usually busy / afk - want to be left alone especially if I'm with someone.
Busy - default status I'm usually on. I might be switching between tabs to make sure I don't disconnect.
